**This project is a smart greenhouse management platform designed to help smallholder farmers in kenya overcome challenges such as pest control, water shortages, and market access through real-time monitoring, AI-driven recommendations, and financial support integration. By providing data-driven insights, training resources, and a marketplace connection, the platform enhances productivity, sustainability, and profitability in greenhouse farming.**

### Background Information
<p>Smallholder farming plays a crucial role in global food production, contributing <b>approximately
70%</b> of the world's food supply while utilizing less than 25% of all agricultural land. However,
smallholder farmers, particularly in Kenya, face significant challenges that hinder productivity
and sustainability. Pests, diseases, high operational costs, lack of technical knowledge, and 
climate variability continue to affect yields and economic viability.
Greenhouse farming has emerged as a solution to mitigate some of these challenges by
providing controlled environments for crop production. Despite its success in large-scale
horticulture, smallholder adoption has been slow, with failure rates between 30% and 70% due
to inadequate knowledge, high setup costs, water scarcity, and poor market access</p>
