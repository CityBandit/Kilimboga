  Generate a well-structured, visually appealing farming guide in strict HTML format for a selected crop in a greenhouse setting. The guide should be formatted as a blog post with proper headings, bullet points, and images for different growth stages. Ensure the content is educational, engaging, and structured in a way that is easy for farmers to follow. Use semantic HTML elements like <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, and <img> to ensure readability and accessibility.
  Do not include any inline styles in the output
  Formatting Requirements:
  1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the guide with a structured summary section including:

  ‚úÖ Crop Name
  ‚úÖ Ideal Temperature Range
  ‚úÖ Growth Duration (days to maturity)
  ‚úÖ Recommended Humidity Levels (important for greenhouse control)
  ‚úÖ Light Requirements (Full sun, partial shade, etc.)
  ‚úÖ Yield Potential (Expected output per plant or per square meter)

  Example:
  <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Growing Tomatoes in Your Greenhouse</h1>
  <div class=summary>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Crop:</strong> Tomato</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Ideal Temperature:</strong> 20-25¬∞C</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> 60-90 days</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Recommended Humidity Levels:</strong> 65-85%</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Light Requirements:</strong> Full sun (at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily)</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Yield Potential:</strong> 4-10 kg per plant per season</p>
  </div>

  2Ô∏è‚É£ Follow with a step-by-step farming plan, covering:

      Soil Preparation (ideal soil type, pH level, fertilizers, composting methods).(each point in a separate <p> tag)
      Planting Guidelines (seed spacing, depth, germination time).
      Watering Schedules (based on real-time soil moisture and weather data).
      Pest & Disease Prevention (common threats and treatments).
      Nutrient Management (fertilizer application schedule).
      Harvesting Best Practices (timing, storage tips).
    - The classes should follow this format:
      - <section class="preparation"> for **Soil Preparation**
      - <section class="planting"> for **Planting Guidelines**
      - <section class="watering"> for **Watering Schedules**
      - <section class="pest-control"> for **Pest & Disease Prevention**
      - <section class="nutrition"> for **Nutrient Management**
      - <section class="harvesting"> for **Harvesting Best Practices**

  3Ô∏è‚É£ üî¥ IMPORTANT: Always include AI-generated images using the Pollinations AI image generator API. Use this format for each image:
  <img src='https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{your-image-description}' alt='{alt-text-description}'>
  Example for soil preparation in tomato farming:
  <img src='https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/preparing%20soil%20for%20tomato%20plants' alt='Preparing soil for tomato plants'>

  4Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure the images are relevant to each stage (e.g., soil preparation, planting, watering, pest control, harvesting). Never use placeholders like https://via.placeholder.com/600x400/. If the AI fails to generate an image, regenerate until it provides a valid URL.
  5Ô∏è‚É£ The HTML should be clean and properly structured without unnecessary <div> wrappers or inline styles. Use proper indentation for readability.
  Now, generate the HTML content for a ${plant} farming guide following these instructions. Ensure every section has an AI-generated image using the Pollinations API.
